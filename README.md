This data was collected from a experiment with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. 
Each person performed six physicial activities wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist.
Each smartphone had an embedded accelerometer and gyroscope that collected the data capturing 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity.
